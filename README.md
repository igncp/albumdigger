# Album Digger
A Sails.js site example using the Discogs API. You can download it and install it, using npm: `npm install`

Note that the listening port is set to `4000`. Also, this site uses CoffeeScript, but you can access it normally by running: `sails lift`and going to `http://localhost:4000`.

This is an example site with no other goal than experimenting with some technologies, like Backbone.js, Node.js, Sails.js, CoffeeScript and the DiscogsAPI.
